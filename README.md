# Smart Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System** is a solution aimed at preventing drunk driving by integrating cutting-edge technology to ensure road safety. This system combines a user-friendly platform, MEMS Ethanol sensors, GPS tracking, and real-time notifications to address the critical issue of impaired driving.

### Key Features:
- **Alcohol Detection**: The system uses MEMS Ethanol Sensors (e.g., MiCS-5524 or MiCS-5525) to detect alcohol concentration in the driver's breath, ensuring high accuracy and minimizing false positives.
- **Engine Locking Mechanism**: If the driver's **Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)** exceeds the legal limit (0.08%), the system activates an engine lock, preventing further driving.
- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: The system sends the driver’s live location to a designated guardian, ensuring immediate action can be taken if needed.
- **Transport Service Integration**: If the BAC is above the legal limit, the system automatically alerts a partnered transport service to send a driver to escort the user home safely.
- **Admin Monitoring**: System administrators can track user data, manage real-time location updates, and coordinate with transport services for a seamless experience.

### How it Works:
1. **User Registration**: Users sign up via a browser-based platform, providing personal details and emergency contacts.
2. **Alcohol Detection & Engine Locking**: A specialized hardware device with an alcohol sensor and GPS module is installed in the user's car. If the alcohol sensor detects a BAC above the legal limit, the engine is locked, preventing the driver from continuing to drive.
3. **Emergency Notifications**: The system sends automated alerts, including the driver’s real-time location, to the guardian or emergency contact.
4. **Transport Coordination**: Upon detection of impaired driving, the system sends the driver’s details to a partnered transport service, ensuring the driver receives an escort.

### Future Developments:
- Expansion to detect other forms of impaired driving (e.g., driver fatigue).
- Continued improvements to sensor accuracy and false positive reduction.
- Further integration with transportation and emergency services for wider coverage.

This system aims to create a safer driving environment and reduce the risks associated with drunk driving by providing real-time interventions and support to both the driver and their emergency contacts.
